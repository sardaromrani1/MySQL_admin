# MySQL_admin
# In this project, at first we run the database_ini.py file to create database authentication file ( output file: database.ini ). After that, we run the mysql_admin.py file which connect to MySQL server running on our localhost (I use MySQL 9.0 ) and do some activities on that database server as following:
1- Create Database
2- Create table
3- List Tables
4- Insert into Table
5- List Databases
6- Drop Database
7- Drop Table
8- List Columns
9- Delete Row
10- Select All Records
11- Select Records with WHERE clause
12- Select sorted Records
13- Update Record
14- Create User
15- Drop User
16- Exit
